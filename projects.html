              <p class="margin">I created a fully function helpdesk application called Huebdesk. HuebDesk is a helpdesk application written in Java. The application was built with JavaFX, Gluon Mobile Plugin, Gluon Glisten API, and Java JDBC. The application connects to a MySQL database, and includes fully functional database operations. This project taught me all about databases and GUI development. Because of this project, I feel confident designing databases and coding in java. I also became intimately familiar with professional APIs and material design philosophy. Click the image to view a video demonstration of the app.</p>
